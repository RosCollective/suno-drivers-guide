# SUNO Driver’s Guide

*A practical guide to listening, structure, and working with generative music.*

This guide was written by people who spent a lot of time actually using SUNO — getting confused, noticing patterns, and slowly learning what helps the system lock in versus drift or soften.

It is not an official manual.
It is not a collection of prompts.
It does not promise results.

It exists to help you recognize what is happening when something works, when it almost works, and when it quietly goes sideways.
