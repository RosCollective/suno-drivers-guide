APPENDIX I
GLOSSARY OF TERMS & ANCHOR PHRASES
(SUNO vocabulary, in plain language)

This appendix collects words and phrases that repeatedly influence how SUNO behaves in practice. These are not rules and they are not magic incantations. They are patterns observed through use.

If a song suddenly softens, slows down, or changes direction in a way you didn’t expect, this glossary is meant to help you recognize why. You do not need to memorize any of this. Think of it as something you dip into when a word behaves differently than you thought it would.

Some of these words act like anchors. They do not add detail so much as reduce guessing, helping SUNO hold its shape instead of drifting into something you didn’t intend.

**TONE & TIMBRE WORDS**
(How the voice sounds)

These words mostly affect how vocals are delivered rather than what notes are sung. They influence clarity, distance, texture, and confidence. If vocals keep turning breathy, washed out, or oddly polite, this is usually where the cause shows up.

breathy / airy  
→ Whisper mode. Soft delivery with lots of air.

crisp vocals  
→ Clear, forward tone. Reduces breathiness.

dry vocals  
→ Low reverb. Tight, close-mic feel.

forward vocal presence  
→ Brings the voice closer in the mix.

minimal breathiness  
→ Actively pulls SUNO out of whisper mode.

raw edge  
→ Adds slight grit and reduces over-polish.

warm tone  
→ Smooth and rounded. Can slide into softness if overused.

**RHYTHM & TEMPO WORDS**
(Energy and pacing)

These words influence pace, momentum, and rhythmic stability. If a song feels sluggish, rushed, or slowly loses energy as it goes on, something in this group is often responsible.

driving beat  
→ Strong, steady percussion that pushes the song forward.

fast-paced  
→ Increases energy and shortens phrasing.

mid-tempo groove  
→ Balanced pace, often landing in a usable middle range.

no drifting  
→ Resists slowdown and loss of focus.

steady pulse  
→ Keeps tempo from dissolving or wobbling.

**INSTRUMENTATION WORDS**
(Texture and genre commitment)

These words steer what instruments show up and how dominant they are. If the mood feels right but the sound palette doesn’t, this section usually explains why.

acoustic guitar  
→ Warm, organic texture. Can soften a track if unbalanced.

clean electric guitar  
→ Bright, defined guitar tone.

driving percussion  
→ Reinforces momentum and structure.

minimal pads  
→ Removes emotional haze and prevents ballad creep.

raw electric bass  
→ Darker, more assertive low end.

subtle synths  
→ Adds atmosphere without washing things out.

**ATMOSPHERE WORDS**
(Mood and emotional color)

These words shape mood and emotional color more than structure. They are powerful and easy to overuse. If a song suddenly feels foggy, heavy, or overly sentimental, look here.

dark / moody / tense  
→ Pushes toward restraint and minor-key feeling.

dreamy  
→ Soft focus with reduced rhythmic clarity.

haunting  
→ Sparse, spacious, often minor-key feel.

intense  
→ Raises emotional pressure.

uplifting  
→ Introduces brightness and optimism.

**ENERGY & INTENSITY WORDS**
(How hard the song pushes)

These words affect attack, contrast, and overall force. If a track feels too aggressive or too restrained, this is the section to scan.

aggressive  
→ Sharper edges and harder attacks.

controlled energy  
→ Forward motion without chaos.

driving  
→ Sustained forward pressure.

restrained  
→ Held-back intensity.

soft  
→ Reduced attack and contrast.

**STRUCTURE & ARRANGEMENT WORDS**
(How the song moves)

These words influence how the song develops over time. If sections blur together, loop too long, or never quite lift, something here is usually involved.

clear transitions  
→ Stronger separation between sections.

dynamic structure  
→ Noticeable rises and falls.

layered textures  
→ Depth through multiple elements.

minimal arrangement  
→ Fewer elements, more space.

variation across sections  
→ Encourages development instead of looping.

**WORDS WITH STRONG SIDE EFFECTS**
(Use on purpose)

Some words do not just add flavor. They quietly change the whole direction of a song. None of these are wrong, but they have a stronger effect than most people expect.

emotional  
→ Often softens vocal delivery and intimacy.

expressive  
→ Loosens performance and timing.

gentle  
→ Reduces attack and energy.

reflective  
→ Slows pacing and pulls the song inward.

tender  
→ Almost always pushes toward softness.

**WORDS THAT REDUCE GUESSING AND DRIFT**
(Small phrases with outsized impact)

These phrases reduce uncertainty more than they add detail. When included, SUNO tends to make fewer guesses and hold its shape more reliably.

clear, present vocals  
→ Keeps the voice forward and intelligible.

minimal pads  
→ Reduces emotional haze.

no drifting  
→ Actively resists slowdown.

steady rhythmic backbone  
→ Holds structure together.

tight arrangement  
→ Limits excess and keeps focus.
