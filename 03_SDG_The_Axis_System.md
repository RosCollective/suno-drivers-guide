CHAPTER 3
THE AXIS SYSTEM — WHY SONGS GO SIDEWAYS (AND HOW TO STOP IT)

By this point, you may have noticed something frustrating but consistent: you can be very clear about what you want and still end up with a song that feels like it is pulling in several different directions at once, even when your prompt looks reasonable on the surface.

SUNO does not follow a single instruction at a time. It responds to multiple influences simultaneously. When those influences reinforce the same idea, the song feels intentional and controlled. When they pull in different directions, the output starts to drift. This is not because your idea is unclear. It is because different parts of your prompt can mean different things to SUNO than they do to you. Words that feel compatible from a human perspective often carry very different implications for the system. When those interpretations conflict, SUNO tries to satisfy all of them at once, and the result is usually a compromise you never intended.

Over time, it became obvious that treating a single prompt as a single instruction made sense from our perspective, but not from SUNO’s. SUNO treats a prompt as several distinct aspects — emotion, genre, rhythm, vocals, structure, and texture — and responds to each of them separately. Once this becomes visible, it also becomes much easier to see where and why a song goes south. What felt vague or arbitrary starts to look understandable and, more importantly, fixable.

The axis system is one practical way — not the only way — to make those interactions visible and workable. It is not a theory and it is not a checklist. It is a way of noticing which parts of a prompt are doing the steering, and whether they agree with each other.  In this guide, an axis is simply a name for one of those aspects. Each axis represents something SUNO makes decisions about independently. You do not need to think about all of them at once. Most problems come from just one or two axes being unclear or quietly pulling against the others.

When the axes align, SUNO stabilizes. When they do not, it defaults to safety.

3.1 THE EMOTIONAL AXIS (E-AXIS)

The emotional axis controls the mood of a song — most obviously in the vocal delivery and chord movement — and answers a practical question: what does this song feel like while it’s happening? For SUNO, emotional language is not decorative; words like dark, energetic, tender, or angry actively push on tempo, vocal tone, texture, and intensity. When emotional direction is clear and consistent, SUNO settles. When it is mixed or vague, SUNO hedges — and hedging has a sound.

Common E-axis signals include:
Dark, Brooding, Energetic, Uplifting, Intense, Tender, Angry, Haunting.

When the emotional axis contradicts the rest of the prompt, you tend to get:
soft rock instead of rock;
dreamy pop instead of indie;
whispery vocals instead of grit.

The fix is not to remove emotional language; it is to make sure the emotional axis supports your musical intention. One clear emotional direction works better than several subtle ones, especially early on.

3.2 THE GENRE / STYLE AXIS (G-AXIS)

The genre axis controls the musical world a song lives in — instrumentation, arrangement habits, and stylistic expectations. Humans treat genre as identity; SUNO treats genre as pattern. When you name a genre, SUNO picks up some of its usual traits, but it does not treat all of them as equally important. Genre suggestions are fragile, and if something else in the prompt is clearer or louder — especially emotion, rhythm, or vocal behavior — genre is usually the first thing SUNO will let go of.

Common G-axis signals include:
indie rock, post-punk, ambient techno, trap, folk, cinematic, lo-fi, acoustic, orchestral.

When the genre axis contradicts other parts of the prompt, you tend to get:
genre dilution;
“average” versions of the style;
songs that feel stylistically correct but emotionally wrong.

Genre tells SUNO what neighborhood you are aiming for; other axes decide what actually gets built there.

3.3 THE RHYTHM / ENERGY AXIS (R-AXIS)

The rhythm or energy axis controls whether a song moves or just sort of exists. This is the axis at play when a track has a tempo but no urgency, when beats are present but timid, or when a song keeps repeating the same section instead of moving forward. That is not a bug; it is what happens when the prompt never clearly commits to energy.

Common R-axis signals include:
fast, driving, minimal, pulsing, slow burn, danceable, restrained, aggressive, sparse.

When the rhythm / energy axis contradicts other parts of the prompt, you tend to get:
tracks with tempo but no urgency;
songs that loop instead of build;
beats that exist without momentum.

If a song stalls, loops, or never builds, the rhythm / energy axis is the second place to look, right after emotion.

3.4 THE VOCAL BEHAVIOR AXIS (V-AXIS)

If there is one place where SUNO gets cautious to the point of absurdity, it is vocals. Vocals are the most exposed part of a song, and when anything else is unclear, SUNO protects the voice first. Safer vocals mean fewer glitches, fewer awkward transitions, and fewer moments where the voice cracks, smears, or suddenly sounds synthetic in an obvious way.

Common V-axis signals include:
confident vocals, aggressive delivery, intimate voice, spoken, shouted, chant-like, detached.

When the vocal behavior axis is unclear or unsupported, you tend to get:
breathy or whispery vocals;
tentative phrasing;
voices that sound “safe” regardless of genre.

If you keep thinking “why is it whispering at me,” this is the axis to check.

3.5 THE STRUCTURE / PROGRESSION AXIS (S-AXIS)

The structure axis controls whether a song goes somewhere. This is the axis you are hitting when a track loops endlessly, when sections feel interchangeable, or when nothing ever peaks. SUNO is cautious about transitions; when it is unsure what comes next, repetition is safer than guessing.

Common S-axis signals include:
verse–chorus, build, breakdown, bridge, drop, progression, escalation.

When the structure axis contradicts other parts of the prompt, you tend to get:
endless looping;
flat songs with no peak;
sections that feel interchangeable.

If a song feels trapped or stalled, the structure axis is usually why.

3.6 THE TEXTURE / PRODUCTION AXIS (T-AXIS)

The texture axis controls how finished a song sounds — space, polish, grit, atmosphere. Texture is the lowest-stakes axis. It rarely breaks a song, but it is the first thing people reach for when something feels wrong.

Common T-axis signals include:
raw, polished, lo-fi, spacious, dry, saturated, atmospheric, gritty.

When texture is used to compensate for other unclear axes, you tend to get:
pretty but empty results;
lots of space with no movement;
production gloss over weak structure.

Texture cannot fix unclear emotion, stalled energy, timid vocals, or missing structure. Used late, texture feels magical. Used early, it feels compensatory. Texture is seasoning, not the meal.

IN PRACTICE

You do not need to specify every axis. Many strong songs only anchor two or three clearly. The danger zone is not omission; it is contradiction. Once you can see which axes you are touching — and whether they agree — SUNO stops feeling mysterious and starts feeling steerable. You do not need to be good at this yet. Being able to notice where things agree or conflict is enough to move forward.

Next, we use the axis system in a practical way, focusing on simple decisions rather than complete prompts.
