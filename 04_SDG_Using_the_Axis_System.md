CHAPTER 4
USING THE AXIS SYSTEM IN REAL PROMPTS

4.1 HOW TO THINK ABOUT PROMPTS (BEFORE YOU WRITE ONE)

This is not about building perfect prompts. It is about making one or two clear decisions at a time and seeing what they do. You are not trying to use every axis. You are just practicing how to notice which ones matter for the song you are working on. A good SUNO prompt isn’t a wishlist. It’s a decision. Most people try to describe the finished song they hear in their head. That makes sense from a human perspective, but it often leads to vague or conflicting instructions. SUNO does not hear your internal reference track. It only sees the words on the page, and it takes all of them seriously. What works better is deciding what actually matters first, and being clear about that before adding detail.

Before you write a prompt, ask yourself a few simple questions:

- What should this song feel like?
- Should it move, or should it stay restrained?
- Do the vocals need to be forward, confident, intimate, or neutral?

If you can answer those, you already have enough information to get a usable result. Genre, structure, and texture can come later, or not at all. 
This is why many short prompts work better than long ones. They commit early and don’t talk themselves out of it. Extra detail only helps if it reinforces the same direction. Pick your must-haves first. These are the few decisions that define the song. Say them clearly. Everything else is a nice-to-have you can leave loose or add later. Most problems show up when a nice-to-have quietly undermines a must-have. You don’t need to control everything. You just need to stop fighting yourself.

4.2 PROMPT STARTING POINTS

Successful prompts are not about finding the right magic phrase. They tend to follow a few reliable ways of starting. Once you recognize those, you can build your own prompts quickly without starting from zero every time. These starting points are not rules. They are patterns that commit one axis early and let the rest follow.

4.3 STARTING POINTS THAT ACTUALLY WORK

Feel First  
Start by anchoring emotional direction clearly, then add only what supports it.

Energy First  
Commit to movement or restraint early so the song knows whether to push or hold back.

Vocals First  
Decide how the voice should behave before worrying about genre or texture.

Structure First  
Imply progression, build, or change so SUNO knows the song is meant to go somewhere.

Restraint First  
Explicitly limit scope so SUNO does not overfill gaps with defaults.

4.4 FULL PROMPT EXAMPLES

You can copy these prompts exactly if you want. They will work. More importantly, they show how to make decisions in the right order. Each example commits to one main must-have first, then only adds details that support that choice.

4.5 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (QUICK FIXES)

Most failures fall into a small number of repeatable buckets. You do not need to start over. You just need to know which axis to adjust.

If a song softens unexpectedly, check emotional direction.  
If it stalls or loops, check rhythm or structure.  
If vocals go breathy, check vocal behavior.  
If genre blurs, check which axis is overpowering it.

You do not need to use the axis system all the time. It is most useful when something feels off and you want a quick way to see why.  
If a song is working, leave it alone. If it is not, change one thing, then listen again.

The templates that follow are designed for exactly this: quick, clear starting points when you don’t want to overthink.
