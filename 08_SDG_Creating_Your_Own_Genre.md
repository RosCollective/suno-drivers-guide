CHAPTER 8
CREATING YOUR OWN GENRE
(Playing without losing the song)

Most people start with a genre because it feels safe; it gives you a place to stand, a set of expectations, and a sense that you’re doing something “correct.” But some of the most interesting results happen when you don’t quite know what to call what you’re making yet, because that unsettled space is where discovery lives. If a song comes back strange, uneven, or not quite anything you recognize, that doesn’t mean it failed — very often it means you’re in the middle of discovering a new lane. This chapter is about how to explore that space deliberately, without turning the process into technical busywork or second-guessing yourself out of the fun.

When you are actively exploring or building a new genre, SUNO will often behave erratically. That is expected. You are asking it to operate in territory without a stable set of patterns yet, so uneven results, odd combinations, and temporary instability are part of the process. This kind of behavior is not a warning sign by itself — it is what exploration looks like when something genuinely new is forming.

Genre thrashing or thrashing in general is what happens when that exploration collapses. It is the point where experimentation turns into noise, and SUNO starts throwing incompatible genres, moods, and structures at you. This usually happens when too many specific instructions, hard boundaries, or conflicting signals are added at once. The key difference is direction. During healthy exploration, the song may be strange, but you still know what you are asking it to do. During genre thrashing, that intention gets buried under too many instructions.

A CONCRETE WAY TO EXPLORE (STEP BY STEP)

The safest way to explore is to be clear about the job of the song before you decorate it.

Start simple:
- Style: indie rock
- Tags: dark, driving

This asks for one clear thing: a dark, energetic indie rock song.

Now add a single layer of complexity:
- Style: indie rock
- Tags: dark, driving, minimal synth texture

The job of the song hasn’t changed. You’re still asking for the same thing, just with a new color added.

Explore by nudging, not piling:
- Keep the style the same.
- Change or add one tag.
- Listen for how the change behaves.

If the song comes back odd but still recognizable, you’re exploring.

WHAT THRASHING LOOKS LIKE IN PRACTICE

Thrashing usually starts when the job of the song becomes unclear.

For example:
- Styles: indie rock, ambient, cinematic, lo-fi
- Tags: dark, uplifting, aggressive, tender, minimal, lush

This prompt asks for too many incompatible things at once. SUNO can’t tell what matters, so it guesses — and the guesses don’t line up.

The result often feels:
- chaotic rather than curious,
- inconsistent from run to run,
- or strangely generic despite lots of detail.

That’s not exploration. That’s collapse.

WHAT TO DO WHEN IT COLLAPSES

When you recognize thrashing, don’t push harder.

Strip back:
- Pick one style.
- Keep two or three tags that clearly support it.
- Remove emotional contradictions.

Then start exploring again from there. Thrashing is not failure; it’s feedback that the system can’t hold the current level of complexity.

PRACTICAL HANDLES FOR STAYING ORIENTED

Before adding detail, ask:
- What is the song’s job?
- What should stay steady if I change something?

Signals you’re exploring:
- The song is strange but coherent.
- Each change teaches you something.
- You want to tweak, not restart.

Signals you’re thrashing:
- You no longer know what you asked for.
- Everything changes at once.
- Results feel noisy or meaningless.

Creating your own genre isn’t about forcing novelty. It’s about holding a clear intention while you explore variations around it. Erratic behavior is part of discovery; collapse is just a signal to simplify and try again.

From here, the focus turns to restraint — knowing when to stop adding — and why less often produces stronger, more distinctive results.
