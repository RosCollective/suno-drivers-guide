AXIS RECAP
HOW THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER

This section is intentionally separate from the main Axis chapter. It exists so you can see the whole system at a glance, without rereading every explanation. You do not need to use every axis for every song. Many strong results only anchor two or three axes clearly. Problems arise not from omission, but from contradiction. Each axis represents something SUNO makes decisions about independently. When those decisions reinforce each other, the song stabilizes. When they pull in different directions, SUNO defaults to safer ground.

THE SIX AXES AT A GLANCE

Emotional Axis (E-Axis)
Controls how the song feels. This is the strongest axis. If it is unclear or conflicted, everything else softens.

Genre / Style Axis (G-Axis)
Controls the musical world the song draws from. Helpful, but fragile. Genre bends easily when other axes disagree.

Rhythm / Energy Axis (R-Axis)
Controls momentum and movement. If this is weak or conflicted, songs stall, loop, or feel timid.

Vocal Behavior Axis (V-Axis)
Controls how the voice acts: confidence, grit, intimacy, presence. SUNO protects vocals aggressively and will soften them first when unsure.

Structure / Progression Axis (S-Axis)
Controls whether the song goes somewhere. If this axis is not implied, repetition is safer than transition.

Texture / Production Axis (T-Axis)
Controls polish, atmosphere, and sonic detail. Lowest stakes. Exaggerates whatever is already happening upstream.

A PRACTICAL NOTE ON FRAGILITY

In practice, axes do not survive conflict equally well. Roughly speaking, they tend to stack from hardest to override to easiest:

1. Emotional direction
2. Rhythm / energy
3. Vocal behavior
4. Genre / style
5. Structure
6. Texture / production

This is not a rulebook. It is a practical observation from use.

HOW TO USE THIS

Use the axis system as a diagnostic tool, not a checklist. When something feels wrong, ask which axis is misaligned or quietly undermined. Most fixes involve adjusting one axis, not rewriting everything.

The diagram that accompanies this section shows the axes as independent controls. You do not need to engage all of them. Alignment matters more than completeness.
