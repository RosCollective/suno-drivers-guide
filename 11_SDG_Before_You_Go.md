BEFORE YOU GO

This guide was never meant to teach you how to make music. It exists to help you recognize when something is working, when it is not, and when to stop pushing. Most of the problems people run into with SUNO are not technical. They come from guessing too much, fixing the wrong thing, or doing the same kind of work for too long. Making music this way is still sometimes a struggle for us, and that is okay. These are some of the useful things we picked up along the way.

We also wished we had a guide like this when we were starting out, which is why we wrote it and are sharing it freely. The goal is not to tell you where to go, but to help you spend less time troubleshooting the vehicle and more time actually driving. We hope it helps people who love music spend more of their time making it.

ABOUT THE APPENDICES

The sections that follow are not required reading. They are not lessons, and they are not a second book hiding in the back. Think of them as reference points you dip into when something feels off and you want to confirm what you are already sensing.

Appendix I (Glossary of Terms & Anchor Phrases) helps you recognize how certain words tend to behave.
Appendix II (Keeping Projects From Colliding) helps you avoid stepping on work that needs a different kind of care.
Appendix III (Style Sheet Dictionary A–Z) goes deeper into style-sheet mechanics for fine control.
Appendix IV (Quick Reference & Field Notes) is a fast sanity check for common patterns.

You do not read these straight through. You use them when you are stuck, uncertain, or double-checking a decision. If you never need them, that is fine too.

Nothing in the appendices replaces listening.
That is the work.
