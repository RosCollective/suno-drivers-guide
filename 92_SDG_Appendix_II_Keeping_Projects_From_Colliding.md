APPENDIX II
KEEPING PROJECTS FROM COLLIDING
(One way to avoid stepping on your own work)

This appendix is about handling, not creativity.

A lot of frustration with SUNO doesn’t come from bad prompts. It comes from doing the wrong kind of work at the wrong time — tweaking something that needs protecting, or protecting something that needs to be pushed harder. Mixing those states makes it easy to break things you actually like, or delete things you meant to keep.

One simple way around that is to separate work by how careful you’re being with it.

This is not a system. It’s just a habit that keeps different kinds of attention from crashing into each other.

You don’t need to copy this. Use the idea, not the layout.

**DIFFERENT PLACES, DIFFERENT RULES**

We don’t keep everything in one workspace. Different stages need different rules. The names don’t matter much — what matters is knowing what you’re allowed to do when you open something.

Here’s how ours usually shakes out.

**THE LAB**
Rule: Nothing is precious.

This is where we experiment. Iterate fast. Change big things. Scrap freely. If something breaks, that’s fine — breaking things is the point here.

If you’re trying to find a direction, this is where you want to be.

WORKSPACE (INTERIM)  
Rule: Be more careful.

This is the in-between zone. You think you might be onto something, but it’s not locked yet. You listen more. You change fewer things at once. You’re still allowed to abandon it, but you’re not thrashing anymore.

A lot of gold waves first show up here.

**THE ALTAR**
Rule: Touch lightly.

This is for songs you really like, but aren’t done listening to yet. Changes here are intentional and small. You’re mostly checking whether it still holds together when you leave it alone.

If you’re constantly “fixing” things here, it probably belongs back in the workspace.

**THE BONEYARD**
Rule: Don’t touch.

For us, this is finished and published material. It’s not dead — it’s complete. Putting it here means we don’t reopen it out of habit or second-guess ourselves later.

Done needs a place to live.

THE KILL LOT (OPTIONAL)  
Rule: Let it go.

Some things served their purpose and don’t need to come back. Parking them somewhere final makes it easier to move on without feeling like you lost something important.

**WHY THIS HELPS**

Separating work like this does one main thing: it removes constant decision-making.

You don’t have to ask, every time you open a song, whether you’re experimenting, refining, or just listening. The place already tells you. That makes it much harder to accidentally wreck something good, or overwork something that’s already done.

If your setup does that — even in a completely different way — it’s working.

That’s the whole point.
