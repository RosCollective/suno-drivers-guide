CHAPTER 5
PRACTICAL PROMPT TEMPLATES THAT ACTUALLY WORK

By this point, you understand why prompts drift and how small contradictions cause big changes, and this chapter is about putting that understanding to work without overthinking it. These templates are not rules and they are not magic phrases; they are examples of clear decision-making. You can copy them exactly and they will work, but more importantly, they show how to commit to what matters first so you can adapt them to your own taste over time. Each template commits to a few must-have decisions up front, then adds only details that support those choices. Common failure modes are blocked early, before SUNO has room to drift. If something doesn’t work, don’t rewrite the whole prompt — adjust one decision at a time.

5.1 TEMPLATE 1 — INDIE NOIR (NO BALLADS)

What You Want  
A dark, atmospheric indie song with energy — no ballads, no softness, crisp vocals, and a driving rhythm.

Your Prompt  
“Create an indie noir track with raw, crisp vocals, driving percussion, minimal atmospheric synths, and an edgy electric bass. Mid-tempo groove with tension, minimal reverb. No ballads, no soft vocals, no dreamy sound.”

What It Does  
Commits early to energy and tension, anchors vocal delivery before it softens, and blocks ballad gravity and dreamy drift.

5.2 TEMPLATE 2 — POP SONG WITH ENERGY (NO DISNEY)

What You Want  
An upbeat pop song that’s catchy without becoming overly sweet or sparkly, with clean vocals and a strong beat.

Your Prompt  
“Write a pop song with strong rhythmic percussion, crisp vocals, catchy melody, bright synths, and a steady beat. Keep it energetic but not ‘Disney princess’ — no soft pads, no lullaby tone.”

What It Does  
Keeps energy forward without tipping into cuteness, anchors rhythm so emotion doesn’t slow the track down, and prevents soft-focus pop defaults.

5.3 TEMPLATE 3 — AMBIENT DARK (NO DRIFTING)

What You Want  
A dark ambient track with space and restraint, without dissolving into fog or mush.

Your Prompt  
“Generate a dark ambient track with sparse piano, low drone bass, and deep atmospheric textures. Minimal reverb, no floaty synths or breathy vocals. Keep the tempo slow and the mood intense. No drifting or loss of clarity.”

What It Does  
Holds intensity even at low energy, prevents texture from taking over, and keeps the track deliberate instead of vague.

5.4 TEMPLATE 4 — INDIE ROCK ANTHEM

What You Want  
An energetic indie rock track with guitars, crisp drums, and a driving beat — no ballads, no floaty vocals.

Your Prompt  
“Write an indie rock anthem with strong electric guitar, punchy drums, driving bass, and clear vocals. Mid-tempo, no ballads, no breathy vocals, and minimal synth pads. Crisp, tight sound.”

What It Does  
Anchors classic rock instrumentation early, keeps energy high without drifting into softness, and holds vocals present and confident.

5.5 TEMPLATE 5 — SOFT INDIE POP (EMOTIONAL BUT CRISP)

What You Want  
An emotional indie pop track with warmth and clarity, without drifting into haze or sentimentality.

Your Prompt  
“Create an indie pop track with soft but clear vocals, light percussion, warm synths, and a catchy melody. Keep the sound emotional but crisp. No excessive reverb or soft pads. Make it dreamy without drifting.”

What It Does  
Allows emotion without surrendering clarity, keeps vocals present instead of washed out, and prevents warmth from collapsing into fog.

5.6 TEMPLATE 6 — CINEMATIC SCORE (INTENSE DRAMA)

What You Want  
A cinematic score with high tension and dramatic weight, focused on orchestral power rather than sweetness or polish.

Your Prompt  
“Create a cinematic score with dramatic orchestral strings, deep brass, pounding percussion, and high tension. Slow build, no electronic sounds, no soft synths. Keep it epic, powerful, and tense.”

What It Does  
Anchors the track in orchestral force, prevents soft textures from taking over, and keeps tension driving the structure.

5.7 TEMPLATE 7 — JAZZ FUSION (GROOVY, COMPLEX)

What You Want  
A jazz fusion track with groove, rhythmic complexity, and room for movement and improvisation.

Your Prompt  
“Write a jazz fusion track with complex drum patterns, electric bass, electric piano, and groovy guitar. Include improvisation and rhythm changes. Keep the melody lively and offbeat, with no overly simple harmonies.”

What It Does  
Anchors rhythmic complexity early, encourages interaction between instruments, and prevents collapse into smooth or predictable jazz.

5.8 TEMPLATE 8 — DARK EXPERIMENTAL (WEIRD AND WOBBLY)

What You Want  
A dark experimental track that explores tension, instability, and unconventional sounds.

Your Prompt  
“Generate a dark experimental track with unconventional rhythms, odd time signatures, and strange electronic textures. Use deep bass, industrial percussion, and eerie vocals. No mainstream sounds, no soft melodies.”

What It Does  
Gives permission to break symmetry, anchors darkness in rhythm and texture, and prevents fallback into safe or familiar patterns.

5.9 TEMPLATE 9 — POP PUNK ANTHEM

What You Want  
A fast, punchy pop-punk anthem with high energy and attitude.

Your Prompt  
“Create a pop-punk anthem with fast, punchy drums, gritty electric guitar, and energetic vocals. Keep the tempo fast and the energy high. No soft pads, no ballad structure. Fun and rebellious.”

What It Does  
Locks in speed and energy immediately, prevents emotional softening or slowdown, and keeps the track punchy and direct.

5.10 TEMPLATE 10 — ACOUSTIC SINGER-SONGWRITER (RAW AND HONEST)

What You Want  
An acoustic singer-songwriter track with intimacy and honesty, without tipping into breathy fragility.

Your Prompt  
“Generate an acoustic singer-songwriter track with raw, intimate vocals, minimal guitar, and soft percussion. Keep it honest, stripped-down, and emotional without becoming overly soft or breathy.”

What It Does  
Preserves intimacy without collapse, keeps vocals present and grounded, and anchors simplicity without sentimentality.

The goal isn’t control. It’s clarity — because once SUNO starts wandering, you’ll spend the rest of your time dragging it back from places it didn’t need to visit. Templates are useful because they reduce guesswork, not because they are perfect. Once you start using them, the real work is knowing what to adjust when something almost works — or works once and then slips.
